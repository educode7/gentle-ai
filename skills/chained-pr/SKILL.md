  Split large changes into chained or stacked pull requests that protect reviewer
  focus and stay within Gentle AI's 400-line cognitive review budget. Trigger:
  when a PR would exceed 400 changed lines, when planning chained PRs, stacked
  PRs, or reviewable slices.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- A planned PR is likely to exceed **400 changed lines** (`additions + deletions`).
- A reviewer asks to split a PR for cognitive load, review fatigue, or burnout prevention.
- You need chained PRs, stacked PRs, or a feature branch with multiple reviewable slices.
- A change should be reviewed in roughly **60 minutes or less** per PR.

Do not use this skill for small fixes or single-purpose changes that fit comfortably under the review budget.

## Critical Rules

| Rule | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| Review budget | **MUST split** when a PR exceeds **400 changed lines** (`additions + deletions`), unless it has maintainer-approved `size:exception` |
| Review time | Design each PR for an approximately **≤60-minute** human review |
| Review health | Optimize for sustainable maintainer attention, not just CI compliance |
| Start and finish | Every chained PR MUST state where it starts, where it ends, what came before, and what comes next |
| Autonomy | Every chained PR MUST be understandable and verifiable on its own |
| Scope | One deliverable work unit per PR; do not mix unrelated refactors, features, tests, or docs |
| Dependencies | State what each PR depends on and what follows next |
| Exceptions | Use `size:exception` only when a maintainer agrees the large diff is unavoidable |

The goal is not bureaucracy. The goal is preventing reviewer burnout so maintainers can review with care instead of skimming exhausted. Big PRs create fatigue, hide defects, and slow merge velocity.

## Autonomy Requirements

Each chained PR must function as a complete review unit:

- **CI green**: checks pass for the PR branch in its intended base context.
- **Autonomous scope**: the PR has one clear deliverable outcome.
- **Reasonable rollback**: reverting this PR does not require reverting unrelated work.
- **Verification included**: tests, docs, or manual verification cover this unit.
- **Reviewable alone**: reviewers do not need to read future PRs to understand this one.

If a slice cannot meet these rules, split it differently. A chain is not a dumping ground for partial, unreviewable diffs.

## Choosing the Split Strategy

| Scenario | Recommended approach | Why |
|----------|----------------------|-----|
| Feature needs isolated integration before main | Feature branch chain | Keeps incomplete work away from `main` |
| Each slice can land independently | Stacked PRs to `main` | Reduces long-lived branch drift |
| API and UI are tightly coupled | Feature branch chain | Allows integration before final merge |
| Backend can ship before UI | Stacked PRs | Faster incremental value |
| Pure generated/vendor/migration diff | `size:exception` | Splitting may add noise without reducing review complexity |

## Chain Boundaries

Every PR in a chain needs explicit boundaries:

| Boundary | What to document |
|----------|------------------|
| Start | The branch, PR, or state this PR builds on |
| End | The finished unit this PR leaves behind |
| Before | Prior PRs reviewers can assume already exist |
| After | Follow-up PRs reviewers should ignore for now |
| Out of scope | Related work intentionally excluded from this review |

## Feature Branch Chain

Use this when multiple PRs should integrate together before landing in `main`.

```text
main
 └── feat/my-feature              # integration branch
      ├── feat/my-feature-01-core # PR targets feat/my-feature
      ├── feat/my-feature-02-cli  # PR targets feat/my-feature
      └── feat/my-feature-03-docs # PR targets feat/my-feature
```

### Steps

1. Create the feature branch from `main`.
2. Open a main/tracker PR from the feature branch to `main` early and mark it as draft/no-merge.
3. Create each implementation branch from the feature branch.
4. Target each chained PR back to the feature branch.
5. Merge the final feature branch to `main` only after all chained PRs are merged and tested together.

### Tracker PR Expectations

The tracker PR is a **chain map**, not the review surface. Keep it draft/no-merge until the child PRs are reviewed and integrated.

- Reviewers should review the child PRs, where each slice stays within the 400-line budget.
- The tracker PR may exceed 400 changed lines because it aggregates the full feature branch by design.
- If the tracker PR exceeds the budget, request/obtain maintainer-applied `size:exception` and document why the aggregate diff is unavoidable.

## Stacked PRs to Main

Use this when each PR can land in `main` in order.

```text
main <- PR 1: foundation
          └── PR 2: feature slice built on PR 1
                └── PR 3: docs/tests built on PR 2
```

### Steps

1. Create PR 1 from `main`.
2. Create PR 2 from PR 1's branch and target it to PR 1's branch.
3. After PR 1 merges, rebase PR 2 on `main` and retarget it to `main`.
4. Repeat until the stack is merged.

## Chain Context Section

Insert this extra section into the existing `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` body. Do **not** replace the repository PR template; the linked issue, PR type, summary, changes, test plan, automated checks, and contributor checklist sections are still required.

```markdown
## Chain Context

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Chain | <feature or stack name> |
| Position | <N of total> |
| Base | `<target branch>` |
| Depends on | <PR/issue/link or "None"> |
| Follow-up | <next PR or "None"> |
| Review budget | <changed lines> / 400 |
| Starts at | <branch, PR, or state this builds on> |
| Ends with | <standalone result delivered by this PR> |

## Scope

- <What this PR includes>
- <What this PR intentionally excludes>

## Autonomy

- [ ] CI is expected to pass for this PR branch
- [ ] This PR has one deliverable scope
- [ ] This PR can be rolled back without unrelated changes
- [ ] Tests, docs, or manual verification cover this unit

## Review Notes

- Review this PR in isolation.
- Do not review dependent PR changes here.
- If this exceeds 400 changed lines, request/obtain maintainer-applied `size:exception` and document the rationale.

## Test Plan

- <command or manual verification>
```

## Commands

```bash
# Check PR size before asking for review
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json additions,deletions,changedFiles,title,url

# Create a chained PR targeting a feature branch
gh pr create --base feat/my-feature --title "feat(scope): focused slice" --body-file pr-body.md

# Create a stacked PR targeting the previous branch
gh pr create --base feat/my-feature-01-core --title "feat(scope): next focused slice" --body-file pr-body.md
```

## Reviewer Guidance

- If a PR exceeds 400 changed lines without `size:exception`, ask for a split.
- Recommend chained PRs when the work must integrate before `main`.
- Recommend stacked PRs when each slice can merge independently.
- Prefer clear dependency notes over clever branch gymnastics.
- Push for autonomy: green CI, clear rollback, and tests or docs for the unit under review.
- Protect reviewer energy. If the chain forces reviewers to reconstruct hidden context, ask for clearer boundaries.
